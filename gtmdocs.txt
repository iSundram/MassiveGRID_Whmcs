Google Analytics sends some event types automatically. This page describes optional, additional events you can configure to measure more behaviors and generate more useful reports for your business. These additional events take more effort to configure before you can use them, so Google Analytics 4 can't send them automatically. For step-by-step instructions on how to configure recommended and custom events for your website or app, see Set up events.

To view details of each event you can use, select your tag management platform:
